#Write a function called hide_and_seek. The function should
#have no parameters and return no value; instead, when
#called, it should just print the numbers from 1 through 10,
#follow by the text "Ready or not, here I come!". Each
#number and the message at the end should be on its own
#line.
#
#Then, call the function.
#
#There should be no print statements outside the function.


#Write your function here!
def hide_and_seek():
    print("1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nReady or not, here I come!")


#Call your function here!
